# GoApply
This app connects potential employers with applicants nearby.

A user will create an account under which they will set up a profile highlighting accomplishments, interests, and goals.
They will then attach a resume to their profile and fill out an interest form on the type of work they are hoping to get.

A recruiter will create an account under a company name and will be able to post open positions. These positions will be seen by anyone within a certain distance of the recruiter while they have the app running, and will be seen only by those
who have the correct interests and are qualified for the position.

A user that sees a position can then verify interest and the recruiter will be able to view the resume and profile of the user.
If the recruiters believes the user to be a good fit, they can open a chat room between themselves and the user to set up a casual interview.

Postings can also be added directly by a company, as long as they have at least one registered recruiter. The location of the business is then the location that a user would have to pass by to see the posting.
This user's profile and request is then sent to the closest recruiter.
